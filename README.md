### Todo app - [Live View](https://nostrand.github.io/fullstack-js-trainee-bootcamp/todo-app/index.html)
This simple to-do list app allows users to manage tasks. Users can add tasks through a form, view the task list, and mark tasks as "Done" to remove them. The initial task list is preloaded with sample items. It's only for testing, it doesn't include local storage.
